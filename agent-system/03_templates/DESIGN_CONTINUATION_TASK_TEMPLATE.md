# DESIGN_CONTINUATION_TASK_TEMPLATE

## Purpose

Use this template for a designer continuation task after accepted research.

The continuation task resumes the original bounded design work using only
research that passed independent audit.

This file is an extension section template. It must be embedded into a full
`TASK_PACKET_TEMPLATE.md`-compatible task packet. It is schema-invalid if used
standalone.

## Rules

- The designer must use only audited research as continuation input.
- Unaudited research, failed audit findings, or informal research notes are not
  valid continuation source-of-truth.
- Continuation scope must remain bounded to the original design task and the
  accepted research implications.
- The continuation task still routes to mandatory design audit on pass.
- A dispatchable design continuation artifact must be embedded in a full
  `# TASK PACKET` and pass task packet schema validation before dispatch.
- A candidate continuation that is not yet dispatchable must be emitted as a
  `TASK_PROPOSAL` with `DISPATCH_STATUS: non_dispatchable`.
- `RETURN_TO_REQUESTER_AFTER_AUDIT_PASS`,
  `RETURN_TO_ROLE_AFTER_AUDIT_PASS`, and `RETURN_TASK_AFTER_AUDIT_PASS` must
  remain deterministic and must not be inferred from research notes or
  conversation history.
