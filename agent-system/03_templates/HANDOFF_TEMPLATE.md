# HANDOFF_TEMPLATE

Use this template when creating a durable handoff record between orchestrator, profile agents, or `project_owner` decision flow.

## Status Lifecycle

- `draft`: created but not dispatchable.
- `active`: current source for the next bounded action.
- `consumed`: completed by the referenced `CONSUMED_BY_RESULT`.
- `superseded`: replaced by `SUPERSEDED_BY`.
- `cancelled`: closed without dispatch by governed orchestrator action.

## Rules

- Only one active handoff may represent the same bounded next action.
- Profile execution role values are `requirements_analyst`, `designer`, `developer`, `auditor`, `tester`, `technical_writer`, `devops_setup_engineer`, and `release_manager`.
- `TARGET_ROLE` may also use control/routing pseudo-roles `orchestrator`, `project_owner`, and `none`.
- `CREATED_BY` may identify a profile execution role, `orchestrator`, or `project_owner`; it must not use `none`.
- `CREATED_AT` is required for every handoff.
- `CONSUMED_BY_RESULT` must remain `NONE` until a valid RESULT consumes the handoff.
- `SUPERSEDED_BY` must remain `NONE` unless another handoff replaces this one.
- Superseded or cancelled handoffs must not be dispatched.
- A handoff cannot override role instructions, task packet scope, runtime state, or governance.
- Agent `NEXT_RECOMMENDED_ACTION` values may inform handoff creation, but they
  are advisory and not authoritative until validated by the orchestrator.
