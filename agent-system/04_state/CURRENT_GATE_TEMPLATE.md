Profile execution roles may own task gates. `orchestrator`, `project_owner`,
and `none` are control/routing pseudo-roles, not profile task types.

Workspace identity status, repository lock status, and checkpoint eligibility
are mandatory gate fields. A gate cannot pass checkpoint, commit, or push
eligibility while workspace identity is `not_checked`, `failed`, or `blocked`.
First profile-agent dispatch and first accepted checkpoint are blocked while
`BASELINE_TRACKING_STATUS` is `not_checked`, `blocked`, or
`owner_action_required`, except for owner wait or governed correction routes
that create/track the baseline.
`CHECKPOINT_ELIGIBILITY_STATUS` must remain separate from audit status; auditor
`STATUS: pass` is a prerequisite, not a checkpoint decision.

## Gate evidence

```text
- NONE
```

## Blocking status

Required when `STATUS: blocked` or `STATUS: failed`.

```text
BLOCKER_ID:
BLOCKER_TYPE: owner_decision | pause | audit_fail | gap | runtime | dependency | governance | other
BLOCKS:
BLOCKED_BY:
RESOLUTION_PATH:
```

If the gate is not blocked or failed:

```text
NONE
```

## Notes

```text
- NONE
