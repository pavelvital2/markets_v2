## Workspace identity

These fields are mandatory for runtime schema version `2.0.0`.

`EXPECTED_GIT_REMOTE` and `ACTUAL_GIT_REMOTE` are canonical repository identity
fields. `PUSH_ALLOWED` defaults to `false` unless an accepted repository lock
authorizes push for the current workspace type, canonical repository identity,
and branch.

`AUDIT_STATUS` records only the independent audit result. It does not authorize
checkpoint, commit, or push by itself. `CHECKPOINT_ELIGIBILITY_STATUS` records
the deterministic post-audit preflight decision, while `COMMIT_STATUS`,
`PUSH_STATUS`, `LAST_PUSH_TARGET_STATUS`, and `PROJECT_CHECKPOINT_STATUS`
separate local commit state, technical push state, push target verification, and
valid project/package checkpoint state.

`BASELINE_TRACKING_STATUS` must be `passed` before first profile-agent dispatch
and before first accepted checkpoint unless the action is an owner wait or
governed correction to create/track the baseline. `project-input/TZ.md` may
remain untracked only when `PROJECT_INPUT_TRACKING_POLICY` explicitly records
`owner-private/untracked`.

## Runtime semantic state

These fields are mandatory and must remain in parity with
`agent-system/04_state/RUNTIME_STATE_SCHEMA.md` and
`agent-system/09_validators/schemas/project_state.schema.json`.

```text
ACTION_SEMANTIC: normal | wait_for_owner | pause | stop_terminal | completed_state_transition
SEMANTIC_REASON:
```

## Active branches

If active branches exist:

```text
BRANCH_ID:
STATUS: active | blocked | completed | archived
CURRENT_TASK:
CURRENT_AGENT_ROLE:
DEPENDENCIES:
BLOCKED_BY: <BLOCKER_ID | GAP_ID | NONE>
```

`CURRENT_AGENT_ROLE` must be one of the profile execution roles:
`requirements_analyst`, `designer`, `developer`, `auditor`, `tester`,
`technical_writer`, `devops_setup_engineer`, or `release_manager`.

If no active branches exist:

```text
NONE
```

## Completed milestones

```text
NONE
```

## Active risks

```text
NONE
```

## Active blockers

```text
BLOCKER_ID:
BLOCKER_TYPE: owner_decision | pause | audit_fail | gap | runtime | dependency | governance | other
STATUS: active | resolving
BLOCKS:
BLOCKED_BY:
RESOLUTION_PATH:
```

If no active blockers exist:

```text
NONE
```

## Active gaps

```text
NONE
```

## Last accepted result

```text
ROLE:
TASK:
DATE:
STATUS:
RESULT_REF:
```

`ROLE` records the profile execution role that produced the accepted result.
Control pseudo-roles `orchestrator`, `project_owner`, and `none` are routing
values and must not be recorded as profile result roles.
