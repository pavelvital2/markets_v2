# RESEARCH_RETURN_VALIDATION_RULES

## Purpose

This document defines documentation-first validation checks for research
dependencies and requester return routing.

## Source documents

agent-system/03_templates/RESEARCH_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md

```

## Required catches

A research dependency or requester return route is invalid when:

- `TASK_KIND: research_dependency` lacks requester return metadata;
- research dependency is used for an owner decision that should be a GAP;
- research dependency is used for a technical obstacle that should be blocked;
- `RETURN_TO_REQUESTER_AFTER_AUDIT_PASS: yes` lacks
  `RETURN_TO_ROLE_AFTER_AUDIT_PASS` or `RETURN_TASK_AFTER_AUDIT_PASS`;
- research output routes directly to requester continuation before audit pass;
- audit fail, blocked, or gap routes to requester continuation;
- continuation task reads unaudited research as accepted input;
- `NEXT_ACTION` drops required requester return context during dependency
  routing;
- task registry omits requester return metadata for dependency tasks.
- research RESULT omits fields required by `research_result.schema.json`.

`RESEARCH_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` and
`DESIGN_CONTINUATION_TASK_TEMPLATE.md` are extension section templates. They
must be embedded into a full `TASK_PACKET_TEMPLATE.md`-compatible task packet;
standalone use is schema-invalid.

## Valid route

```text
requester task
-> research_dependency task
-> research RESULT
-> auditor
-> audit pass
-> post-audit Git checkpoint if required
-> requester continuation task
```

This route is sequential. It does not allow generalized parallel orchestration.
