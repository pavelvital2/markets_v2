# TASK_PACKET_VALIDATION_RULES

## Purpose

This document defines documentation-first validation rules for bounded task
packets.

## Source documents

```text
agent-system/03_templates/TASK_PACKET_TEMPLATE.md
agent-system/02_runtime/FILESYSTEM_GOVERNANCE.md
agent-system/02_runtime/STATE_TRANSITION_RULES.md
agent-system/02_runtime/ACCEPTED_STATE_LOCKING.md
agent-system/02_runtime/REQUESTER_RETURN_PROTOCOL.md
agent-system/04_state/RUNTIME_STATE_SCHEMA.md
agent-system/09_validators/REASONING_LEVEL_VALIDATION_RULES.md
```

## Required structure

A task packet is invalid if it omits required sections from the current
`TASK_PACKET_TEMPLATE.md`.

Validators must check the current template rather than freezing a separate
schema here.

`RESEARCH_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` and
`DESIGN_CONTINUATION_TASK_TEMPLATE.md` are extension section templates. They
are schema-invalid if dispatched standalone and are valid only when embedded in
a full `TASK_PACKET_TEMPLATE.md`-compatible task packet.

## Bounded scope checks

A task packet is invalid when:

- purpose contains multiple unrelated objectives;
- scope in contains hidden follow-up work;
- scope out is missing;
- required docs force an agent to read the whole project;
- acceptance criteria expand beyond scope in;
- expected outputs are not verifiable;
- workflow fields contradict governance.
- `REASONING_LEVEL` is missing, invalid, below the gate-required floor, or
  lowered below role default without a valid mechanical-task `OVERRIDE_REASON`;
- `TASK_KIND: research_dependency` lacks requester return metadata or expected
  research evidence.

## ACTIVE_DOC_ROOT checks

For ordinary project work:

- active task packets must be inside `ACTIVE_DOC_ROOT`;
- active project docs must be inside `ACTIVE_DOC_ROOT`;
- `project-archive/` cannot be active source-of-truth;
- deprecated or superseded docs cannot be in `REQUIRED_DOCS`;
- `NEXT_ACTION` cannot dispatch deprecated or superseded task packets.

The only active task packet exception outside `ACTIVE_DOC_ROOT` is the first
bootstrap profile-agent dispatch packet:

```text
project-runtime/bootstrap/TASK_BOOTSTRAP_<TARGET_ROLE>_001.md
```

Validators must reject any ordinary task packet outside `ACTIVE_DOC_ROOT`.
They must also reject handoff files used as task packets, profile-agent
dispatch without a task packet, and more than one active first bootstrap task
packet at the same time.

For the first bootstrap exception, validators must also confirm that the
corresponding `NEXT_ACTION` uses the current required fields from
`NEXT_ACTION_TEMPLATE.md` and references the canonical path:

```text
project-runtime/bootstrap/TASK_BOOTSTRAP_<TARGET_ROLE>_001.md
```

Universal package upgrade tasks may change `agent-system/` only when a bounded
task packet explicitly authorizes that scope.

## Allowed and forbidden file checks

Every task packet must define bounded file-change authority.

Invalid conditions:

- `ALLOWED_FILE_CHANGES` is missing;
- `ALLOWED_FILE_CHANGES` is effectively unbounded;
- wildcard scope is broader than the task purpose requires;
- `FORBIDDEN_FILE_CHANGES` is missing when protected zones exist;
- allowed and forbidden patterns overlap without explicit clarification;
- protected zones are mutable without role and task authority.

Protected zones include:

```text
agent-system/
project-runtime/
project-input/
project-archive/
```

## Required docs checks

`REQUIRED_DOCS` is invalid when it includes:

- deprecated docs;
- superseded task packets;
- archive-only references for active source-of-truth;
- secrets or credential files;
- unrelated reference documents;
- entire directory trees without bounded need.

## Workflow checks

A task packet is invalid when it allows or requires:

- designer pass directly to developer;
- developer pass directly to tester or technical writer;
- audit bypass after designer or developer work;
- audit fail to normal next task;
- audit fail to Git checkpoint;
- correction without a fresh bounded task where correction is required;
- terminal completion by profile-agent RESULT alone.
- requester continuation before research audit pass;
- audit fail, blocked, or gap routing to requester continuation;
- research dependency used as a substitute for GAP or BLOCKER handling.

## Reasoning level checks

Allowed levels are:

```text
low
default
high
maximum
role_default
```

Task packets may raise reasoning level freely. They may lower below role
default only for mechanical bounded tasks and only with `OVERRIDE_REASON`.
They must not lower below the gate-required floor. `low` is forbidden for
design, requirements, audit, correction after failed audit,
lifecycle/state/transition changes, security/secrets policy, launch/release
readiness, final acceptance, and cross-link validation.

## Research dependency checks

For `TASK_KIND: research_dependency`, validators must require:

```text
REQUESTED_BY_ROLE
REQUESTED_BY_TASK
RESEARCH_QUESTION_ID
RESEARCH_PURPOSE
RESEARCH_QUESTIONS
ALLOWED_SOURCES
FORBIDDEN_SOURCES
EXPECTED_EVIDENCE
EXPECTED_OUTPUT
RETURN_TO_REQUESTER_AFTER_AUDIT_PASS
RETURN_TO_ROLE_AFTER_AUDIT_PASS
RETURN_TASK_AFTER_AUDIT_PASS
AUDIT_REQUIREMENTS: mandatory
```

Research dependencies are invalid if they request owner decisions, omit allowed
or forbidden sources, omit expected evidence, or allow requester return before
independent audit pass.

## Role enum checks

Profile execution `TASK_TYPE` values are limited to:

```text
requirements_analyst
designer
developer
auditor
tester
technical_writer
devops_setup_engineer
release_manager
```

For profile execution tasks, `TARGET_ROLE` must match `TASK_TYPE` unless the
packet explicitly documents a governed exception.

Control pseudo-roles are:

```text
orchestrator
project_owner
none
```

They are valid in control/routing contexts, such as next-role routing, owner
waits, and terminal routing. They are invalid as profile execution `TASK_TYPE`
values unless a governance-only exception is explicitly documented.

## Correction task checks

Correction task packets must include:

```text
CORRECTION_OF
SOURCE_RESULT_REF
ATTEMPT_NO
FAILURE_TYPE
```

Invalid correction packets include:

- missing source result or violation reference when one exists;
- scope broader than the failed surface without designer approval;
- missing mandatory audit path;
- repeated same failure without escalation path.

## Secret-safety checks

A task packet is invalid when it asks an agent to:

- read, print, create, modify, stage, commit, or push secrets;
- include secret values in evidence;
- inspect credential files without an explicit redaction-only protocol;
- use real credentials as acceptance evidence.

Secret-related evidence must be redacted and path/class based.

## Project-agnostic checks

Universal agent-system task packets are invalid if they introduce
project-specific business terms into universal core files.
