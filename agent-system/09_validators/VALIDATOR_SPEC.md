# VALIDATOR_SPEC

## Purpose

This document defines the universal validator layer for the deterministic
agent-system runtime.

The validator layer is documentation-first. It specifies required checks,
failure classes, and routing expectations. It does not require a working CLI,
script, service, or executable implementation.

Validators help the orchestrator detect:

- inconsistent runtime state;
- invalid state transitions;
- invalid task packets;
- invalid agent RESULT payloads;
- unsafe or unauthorized file changes;
- unsafe Git checkpoint attempts;
- stale or missing package cross-links;
- unsafe research dependency return routing;
- invalid reasoning level assignments;
- secret-handling violations.

## Source of authority

Validator rules must comply with:

```text
agent-system/02_runtime/GOVERNANCE_AUTHORITY.md
agent-system/02_runtime/STATE_TRANSITION_RULES.md
agent-system/02_runtime/VIOLATION_RECOVERY.md
agent-system/02_runtime/ACCEPTED_STATE_LOCKING.md
agent-system/02_runtime/FILESYSTEM_GOVERNANCE.md
agent-system/03_templates/AGENT_RESULT_TEMPLATE.md
agent-system/03_templates/TASK_PACKET_TEMPLATE.md
agent-system/04_state/RUNTIME_STATE_SCHEMA.md
```

If this validator specification conflicts with runtime governance, runtime
governance wins and this specification must be corrected.

## Machine-readable schema sidecars

The universal package also provides JSON Schema sidecars for structures that
are represented to humans as Markdown templates:

```text
agent-system/09_validators/schemas/project_state.schema.json
agent-system/09_validators/schemas/current_gate.schema.json
agent-system/09_validators/schemas/next_action.schema.json
agent-system/09_validators/schemas/task_packet.schema.json
agent-system/09_validators/schemas/result.schema.json
agent-system/09_validators/schemas/research_result.schema.json
agent-system/09_validators/schemas/task_registry.schema.json
agent-system/09_validators/schemas/accepted_artifacts.schema.json
agent-system/09_validators/schemas/orchestrator_event.schema.json
```

These sidecars use JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 as the machine-readable target
format. They define the equivalent structured object form for files that are
authored, displayed, or exchanged as Markdown.

## Markdown mirror and structured source rule

Markdown templates remain the human-readable operating surface for agents and
owners. JSON Schema sidecars define the canonical machine-readable field set,
required keys, enum values, and nested structures for validators.

When both forms exist:

- the Markdown template must list the same required fields as its schema
  sidecar;
- a runtime Markdown file may be parsed or transformed into the sidecar object
  shape before validation;
- a YAML or JSON runtime source may be rendered into Markdown for human review
  if the rendered Markdown preserves all required fields;
- validators must not infer missing required values from prose or context;
- if a Markdown template and sidecar conflict, runtime governance and the
  current template are the authority until a bounded package update reconciles
  the sidecar;
- no runtime dispatch depends on a parser, renderer, CLI, or validator
  implementation that is not present. Such automation is optional future
  tooling unless separately implemented and accepted.

The sidecars are therefore validation specifications, not a requirement that
the current package already contains executable validation tooling.

## Validation points

The orchestrator should apply validator rules at these points:

```text
before_dispatch:
  runtime consistency
  task packet validity
  transition validity
  reasoning level floor validity
  research/requester return validity when applicable

after_agent_result:
  result validity
  research result schema validity when TASK_KIND is research_dependency
  file-scope validity
  transition validity

before_audit_dispatch:
  runtime consistency
  audit task packet validity

after_audit_result:
  result validity
  research result schema validity when auditing TASK_KIND research_dependency
  transition validity
  accepted-state rules
  research/requester return validity when applicable

before_git_checkpoint:
  Git checkpoint validity
  secret-safety checks
  allowed/forbidden file checks
  research return blocked unless audit pass preconditions hold
```

Reasoning-level validation is auditable evidence. Validators must check the
dispatch record, handoff, spawn log, or orchestrator transcript for
`REASONING_LEVEL_REQUIRED`, `REASONING_LEVEL_ACTUAL`,
`REASONING_LEVEL_COMPLIANCE`, and `SPAWN_LOG_REF` or `HANDOFF_LOG_REF`.
Missing evidence, unknown evidence, or an actual level below the required floor
must fail or block the audit according to
`REASONING_LEVEL_VALIDATION_RULES.md`.

## Role enum validation baseline

Validators that inspect runtime routing fields must use the control/target role
enum:

```text
orchestrator
requirements_analyst
designer
developer
auditor
tester
technical_writer
devops_setup_engineer
release_manager
project_owner
none
```

Validators that inspect profile execution task types must use:

```text
requirements_analyst
designer
developer
auditor
tester
technical_writer
devops_setup_engineer
release_manager
```

`orchestrator`, `project_owner`, and `none` are control/routing pseudo-roles.
They are valid for orchestrator control flow and owner/terminal routing, but not
for profile execution `TASK_TYPE` values unless a governance-only exception is
explicitly documented.

## Failure classification

Validator failures are orchestrator-classified violations or routing blockers.
Profile agents still return only:

```text
pass
fail
blocked
gap
```

`violation` is not a profile-agent RESULT status. It is an orchestrator
classification for recovery and logging.

## Common validation outcomes

```text
valid:
  Continue governed routing.

invalid_recoverable:
  Log violation or invalid state.
  Enter correction flow.

invalid_blocked:
  Log blocker.
  Route to wait_for_owner only when owner input is required.

invalid_terminal:
  Stop dispatch until governance or owner correction is provided.
```

## Secret-safety baseline

Validators must never require reading, printing, storing, staging, committing,
or pushing secret values.

Secret-safety checks should verify paths, file names, diff metadata, and
redacted indicators only. If a suspected secret value is encountered, the
validator result must refer to the path and violation class without reproducing
the value.

## File-scope baseline

Every validator that inspects changes must compare changed paths against:

- task packet `ALLOWED_FILE_CHANGES`;
- task packet `FORBIDDEN_FILE_CHANGES`;
- role authority in filesystem governance;
- runtime restrictions on `agent-system/`, `project-runtime/`,
  `project-input/`, and `project-archive/`.

Any path outside allowed scope is a workflow/filesystem violation.

## Project-agnostic rule

Validator rules must remain universal. They must not include business-domain
terms, application-specific implementation details, or project-specific
exceptions.

## Final smoke fixture

The package includes a documentation-level final smoke checklist:

```text
agent-system/10_examples/FINAL_SMOKE_CHECKLIST.md
```

This checklist is a validation aid for final package review. It verifies that
required upgrade documents exist and that lifecycle, role, task/result, state,
audit/checkpoint, setup/run/launch/handover, profile, GAP/owner, secret-safety,
and project-agnostic rules do not contradict each other. It does not require a
runtime validator implementation, production deployment, external repository, or
credential access.
