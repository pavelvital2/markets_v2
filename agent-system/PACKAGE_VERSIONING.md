# PACKAGE_VERSIONING

## Purpose

This document defines minimal package versioning policy for the universal orchestration package. It is not a release manifest and does not list every artifact.

## Runtime version fields

Mandatory runtime version fields:

```text
PACKAGE_VERSION:
GOVERNANCE_RULESET_VERSION:
RUNTIME_SCHEMA_VERSION:
```

`PROJECT_STATE.md` must contain these fields and reference the active values unless a governed migration task explicitly changes them.

## Active version constants

```text
CURRENT_PACKAGE_VERSION: 2.0.0
CURRENT_GOVERNANCE_RULESET_VERSION: 2.0.0
CURRENT_RUNTIME_SCHEMA_VERSION: 2.0.0
```

These constants define the active package/governance/schema tuple for runtime validation. They are policy constants, not a release manifest.

## Correction semantics

Owner-authorized corrections may reconcile internally inconsistent artifacts
inside an accepted package version when the intended public package capability
is already installed. Such corrections are recorded in `GOVERNANCE_CHANGELOG.md`
and must state whether the active tuple changed.

The v1.2.0 correction chain keeps the active tuple unchanged:

```text
CURRENT_PACKAGE_VERSION: 1.2.0
CURRENT_GOVERNANCE_RULESET_VERSION: 1.2.0
CURRENT_RUNTIME_SCHEMA_VERSION: 1.1.0
```

Runtime file set synchronization, role/task enum synchronization, RESULT field
normalization, documentation stage reconciliation, and final smoke/cross-link
hardening in that chain are treated as v1.2.0 correction metadata, not as a new
package installation.

These correction entries do not reserve or pre-install any future minor package
version. A later package installation must use its own owner-authorized bounded
package update, active tuple change, migration note, and changelog entry.

The v1.3.0 feature upgrade installs:

```text
CURRENT_PACKAGE_VERSION: 1.3.0
CURRENT_GOVERNANCE_RULESET_VERSION: 1.3.0
CURRENT_RUNTIME_SCHEMA_VERSION: 1.2.0
```

This upgrade adds Research Dependency Loop, Design Research Loop, Requester
Return Protocol, explicit reasoning-level governance, requester return metadata
fields, and runtime tuple cleanup for `CURRENT_GATE.ACTION_SEMANTIC` and
`NEXT_ACTION.ACTION_SEMANTIC`. It must not use `1.2.1` as the active tuple.

The v2.0.0 governance hardening package installs:

```text
CURRENT_PACKAGE_VERSION: 2.0.0
CURRENT_GOVERNANCE_RULESET_VERSION: 2.0.0
CURRENT_RUNTIME_SCHEMA_VERSION: 2.0.0
```

This major update makes workspace identity validation and repository lock
validation mandatory before profile-agent dispatch, runtime initialization,
checkpoint, commit, or push. Existing runtime states that lack the mandatory
workspace identity, repository lock, or checkpoint eligibility fields enter
correction or owner wait flow; the orchestrator must not silently infer those
fields from folder name, inherited `.git` metadata, or raw remote strings.

The governance smoke-test addition for
`TASK_ASO_PATCH_008_GOVERNANCE_SMOKE_TESTS` keeps the active tuple unchanged at
`2.0.0 / 2.0.0 / 2.0.0`. It adds deterministic local fixtures and a dry-run
runner for the v2.0.0 blocker surface; it is recorded in
`GOVERNANCE_CHANGELOG.md` and does not install a new package version.

## Version semantics

```text
PATCH  = wording, formatting, or non-semantic clarification
MINOR  = compatible hardening; new validation or fields that do not change accepted state meaning
MAJOR  = changes to mandatory transitions, role authority, filesystem authority, terminal semantics, required runtime files, or status meanings
```

## Package update rules

1. Universal package changes occur only through owner-authorized bounded package update task.
2. Normal project agents cannot change `agent-system/`.
3. Package update activates governance freeze for normal project dispatch.
4. Runtime schema, templates, runtime loop, and governance docs in the compatibility set must be compatible before freeze exits.
5. Package change must be recorded in `GOVERNANCE_CHANGELOG.md`.
6. Existing project runtime state that lacks newly mandatory fields enters correction/wait flow, not silent inference.

## Compatibility rule

A package version is valid only when the compatibility set is mutually compatible for the active package version, governance ruleset version, and runtime schema version.

The compatibility set includes at minimum:

```text
RUNTIME_STATE_SCHEMA.md
PROJECT_STATE_TEMPLATE.md
CURRENT_GATE_TEMPLATE.md
NEXT_ACTION_TEMPLATE.md
GAP_REGISTER_TEMPLATE.md
AGENT_RESULTS_LOG_TEMPLATE.md
ORCHESTRATOR_RUNTIME_LOOP.md
ALLOWED_ORCHESTRATOR_ACTIONS.md
FILESYSTEM_GOVERNANCE.md
GOVERNANCE_AUTHORITY.md
STATE_TRANSITION_RULES.md
VIOLATION_RECOVERY.md
ACCEPTED_STATE_LOCKING.md
```
